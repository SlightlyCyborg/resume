        - name: Choreo
          description: A library to concurrently control multiple servos as a function of position & time on Arduino. Uses linear interpolation to generate and send interleved position commands to the servos. "Take 4 seconds to move 20 degrees" is an example command. Interpolation is abstracted such that other interpolation types could be used (logistic seems like a good candidate to ease actuators in and out of their positions).
